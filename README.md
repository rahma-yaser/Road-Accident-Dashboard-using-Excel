## Project Overview

This project is a **comprehensive Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Excel**. The main objective is to analyze road accident casualties and uncover patterns related to accident severity, vehicle type, road conditions, location, time, and environmental factors. The dashboard converts raw accident data into meaningful insights through structured data cleaning, analysis, and interactive visualizations.

The project demonstrates strong skills in **data analysis, Excel-based reporting, and dashboard design**, without using external BI tools.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains detailed records of road accidents and casualties across multiple years. Each record represents an accident event with associated attributes describing casualty severity, vehicle involvement, road characteristics, and environmental conditions.

### Key Data Attributes

* **Accident Date** – Used for time-series and yearly trend analysis
* **Casualty Severity** – Fatal, Serious, and Slight
* **Vehicle Type** – Car, Truck, Bus, Bicycle, Agricultural vehicles, and others
* **Road Type** – Single carriageway, Dual carriageway, Roundabout, One-way street, Slip road
* **Road Surface Condition** – Dry, Wet, Ice
* **Location Type** – Urban or Rural
* **Light Condition** – Daylight or Dark
* **Casualty Count** – Number of casualties per accident

The dataset serves as the foundation for all metrics, KPIs, and visualizations presented in the dashboard.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

Before building the dashboard, the dataset was cleaned and prepared using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency:

* Removal of duplicate and irrelevant records
* Handling missing and blank values
* Standardization of categorical fields (severity, road type, surface, location)
* Formatting date fields for time-based analysis
* Validation of numeric fields for aggregation
* Creation of helper columns to support pivot tables and KPIs

These steps ensured the dataset was analysis-ready and reliable.

## Key Metrics & KPIs

The dashboard highlights critical performance indicators, including:

* **Total Casualties:** 417,883
* **Fatal Casualties:** 7,135 (1.7%)
* **Serious Casualties:** 59,312 (14.2%)
* **Slight Casualties:** 351,436 (84.1%)
* **Casualties by Car:** 333,485 (79.8%)

These KPIs provide an immediate overview of accident severity and impact.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The Excel dashboard includes multiple interactive charts and summaries:

### 📊 Casualties by Severity

Donut charts showing the distribution of fatal, serious, and slight casualties.

### 🚗 Casualties by Vehicle Type

Visual comparison of casualties involving cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, agricultural vehicles, and others.

### 📈 Yearly & Monthly Trend Analysis

A line chart comparing **2021 vs 2022 monthly casualties**, highlighting seasonal patterns and trends.

### 🛣️ Casualties by Road Type

Bar chart analysis of casualties across different road structures, showing higher incidents on single carriageways.

### 🌧️ Casualties by Road Surface

Tree map visualization comparing dry, wet, and icy road conditions.

### 🌆 Casualties by Location

Donut chart distinguishing **Urban vs Rural** accident impact.

### 🌙 Casualties by Light Condition

Analysis of accidents occurring in daylight versus dark conditions.

## Interactivity & Filters

The dashboard includes interactive **slicers and filters** that allow users to:

* Filter by **Year**
* Filter by **Urban or Rural** location
* Dynamically update all visuals based on selected criteria

This interactivity enables deeper exploration of the data.
